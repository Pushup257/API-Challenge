  <p style="color:#FF0000";>6-14-2017 The first activity we did at camp was the blind fold walk. Thoughout this challange I learned how to trust a brother I've never met. At first my partner Alex was blind folded and I rememeber that Alex was scared when we took the first walk, I didn't believe him at first until it was my turn to walk. I had so many  mixs feelings and I was very nervous and frighten that I might ran into a tree. But  I thought to myself the same way I guided Alex to walk up the hill with no problems. I needed to trust him and follow his instruction verbally.After the first activity I got communicate more with Alex and I learned his hobbies. Alex enjoy playing socccer, boxing, and thai kuando. He is fighter and  I never imagined  that he has cool atribute based on  his apperance.  This activity  really stregnthen the brotherhood and I learned to not judge a person based on apperance, but instead initiate a conversation to learn more about a person. The next activity was the human Knot. At first the group that I was in never progressed to the actual knot because too many ideas were thrown around and  we  all overanalyzed the problem. I notice that communication and time management lacked in this activity. After a couple of hours of attemps trying to solve the problem, we got it. It was all about trial and error, and the concept of teamwork. Toward the end of the human knot activity we communictaed effectively and help each other. Yet, I was mostly silent through out this challenge which  made me disappointed at myself. I realized that working in group can have benefits than working alone to solve a problem and failure isn't bad because you can always retry to find a solution. In addition, the one thing that I did not mention is that earlier today I had to miss my last day of school to drive to camp. Even though I missed my last day of my freshman year I got to communicate new students i never met. Once I arrived to camp, and had lunch. I did not have no ackward feeling toward the other students because I got to talk to them on the bus.</p> 


  <p style="color:#FF0000";>6-15-2017 Day 2 of Camp. The exercises from the day before really pushed my body and mind, so that today my body would feel sore with no energy. Even though my body felt this way I learned to keep on pushing yourself, no matter how difficult the situation. Keeping a positive mind fuels your mind for success. I woke up the morning with a cold shower, and morning lecture by Oscar. Mostly talking about how we need to depend on each other, also to get ahead of the game, and to not follow any trends. Right after we had breakfast, which was amazingly good and delicious. First activity of the day was, when we got into 2 groups, team Honda and team Google. We raced up the hill where the basket ball court was located, once we reached the top we chose a partner from the opposite team, and asked him “who are you”. I learned that me and my partner(Luis) were both silent which is ok. But sometimes you cant be silent, you need a voice so people can hear your thoughts. Later that day they gave about 15 min to reflect outside with the wilderness. As of this point I feel as if I can’t keep up with everyone else. I know I don’t want to be a follower I want to lead. I know I want to make a change, no its up for me to take that challenge. I consider myself a coward because I’m always to scared to speak up. One thing to Know is that your identity does matter in life, Followers only follow those who have a good identity, which result to success. Something I applied on this afternoons activity, was ho communication is key for success in a group. If you communicate you not only improve the bond with the members, but allows “integrative thinking”.</p>  


<p style="color:#FF0000";>6-16-2017 Day 3 of Camp. Woke up even earlier than usual This day most of the coaches and txt’r kept telling us lil’s to remember what we have learned the past few days. I didn’t quite understand why, until we started the first activity of the day. Which was the “Lava Game” we spilt into the groups from the day before team Honda and team Google, we had to race each other on time.  At first we had terrible communication, and no goal to have everyone cross the lava. This really pissed off everyone one because we were all lost, the heat really burned us that day, which was an unpleasant feeling. From 11 am to 5pm neither group completed the task, we. The txt’r gave us clues and hints to the answers. That whole day most of us reflected on a way to complete the task, by trying to apply what we learned the last couple of days. We didn’t even eat dinner that afternoon.</p>


<p style="color:#FF0000";>6-17-2017 Day 4 of Camp. We woke up at 5am to head a back over to the park where we did the lava game. None of us ate breakfast that morning and for about 3-4 hours we played the game with no food tired. Oscar then gave us an hour to reflect on our errors, he also bought everyone breakfast and filled our water bottles. After and hour the other group managed to beat us with the help of coaches. Which our team considered cheating so we didn’t try to ask for the coaches for help. While the other group was eating ice-cream our group was in the sun trying to finish the task. It took us till 5pm or 6pm to complete it we then used the coaches for help. The lesson it the look at your surroundings and ask for help. Out group took us 2 whole days to complete the challenge. Later that night like around 11 we played the stick game. The txt’rs and Oscar gave use hints. 1) don’t think about the problem 2) think outside the box 3) the answer is under our noses. It took me 2 hours to complete the task because I thought to hard about the problem. Which was my fault. The Lesson is that is to look at your surrounding, thinking about the problem won’t help it will worsen it.</p>


<p style="color:#FF0000">6-18-2017 Day 5 of Camp. Last day of camp it was actually pretty chill; we ate a good breakfast then we had like a shirt ceremony. Over the last couple of days, I’ve learned to value my brothers and think outside the box. This camp experience has been amazing for me, its something ill never forget. I’m glad I am part of the TXT family.</p>  


<p style="color:#FF0000">6-21-2017 Week 1 day 1. Today I learned about how a leader should always be able to listen and speak to other well. Every single person in a group will have their own personal strengths we just need to use those strengths to our advantage so a group will succeed to its fullest potential. Also if you try to convince yourself into achieving your goal it will happen. Never let other people define who you are as a person, if you do you’ll never grow. We talked a lot about our communities and how they not only effect the people in it but the people around it. I figured out that I was part of gaming call of duty community, and swimming community. These communities help the people in it benefit from it or argue about it. All the different thoughts help make the community be as one also they grow as one.</p>
