             <p  style="color:#FF0000";>Hello Everyone, The Entreprenuer I decided to reseach is James C. Smith becuase of the unique and Interesting website he provides for the world. This website is called Thomas Reuters and its Purpose is to enable professionals in the financial and risk, legal, tax and accounting, and media markets to make the decisions that matter most, all powered by the world's most trusted news organization.  Without insightful people and intuitive technology, data has no source and no direction. Mr. James C. Smith, also known as Jim, has been Chief Executive Officer and President of Thomson Reuters Corporation since 2012. Mr. Smith served as chief operating officer of Thomson Reuters Corporation from September 28, 2011 to December 2011. He served as Chief Executive Officer of Professional Division of Thomson Reuters Corporation form April 2008 to September 2009. He served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Thomson Corporation .It's just noise. The Thomson-Reuters merger transaction was reviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice and by the European Commission. On February 19, 2008, both the Department of Justice and the Commission cleared the transaction subject to minor divestments. The Department of Justice required the parties to sell copies of the data contained in the following products: Thomson's WorldScope, a global fundamentals product; Reuters Estimates, an earnings estimates product; and Reuters Aftermarket (Embargoed) Research Database, an analyst research distribution product. The proposed settlement further requires the licensing of related intellectual property, access to personnel, and transitional support to ensure that the buyer of each set of data can continue to update its database so as to continue to offer users a viable and competitive product.The European Commission imposed similar divestments: according to the Commission's press release, "the parties committed to divest the databases containing the content sets of such financial information products, together with relevant assets, personnel and customer base as appropriate to allow purchasers of the databases and assets to quickly establish themselves as a credible competitive force in the marketplace in competition with the merged entity, re-establishing the pre-merger rivalry in the respective fields..Thats why Thomas Reutor was invented, to help our world/community expand the knowledge of data.</p>
