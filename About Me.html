     <p>Hello, Everyone my name is Danny Castro. I will tell you a little about myself. I am the youngest of 3 kids in my family, and I am 14. 3 of the hobbies I enjoy doing in my free time is playing guitar(Accoustic/Electric), and swimming when I have the time too. And finally riding my bike.</p>
     <p>The Hobby I enjoy the most is playing guitar, because of the sound and harmony it brings to me. I spend about 2 hours per day trying to improve my skills and become the best I can be. This intrument has taught me a lot about time management, Because when you learn to play an intrument helps you become more organized  and manage your time wisely. it has really effected my life for the better. I have notice that I procrastinate less and I am able to multitask several activities like playing my guitar and concentrate in my studies .In addition, I  am also one of the musician at my church. </p>
     <p>My second favorite hobby that I enjoy doing is swimming because of how it teaches me to push through any hard task and keep my mind and body at peace. It helps me boost my mood when I am stress and also helps me with my cardio and muscle.</p>
     <p>Finally, my last hobby is to ride my bike to school becuase it not only help the enviroment but it helps my parents with the gas. I really wanted to be independent instead of having my mom or sisters drop off in the morning.During the weeekend, I wake up  early and meet up with my friends to use the bike at the Marina del Rey beach.</p>
